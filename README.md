# shift

![icon](icon.svg)

This is an app to create monthly work schedules. Detailed documentation is 
in the works and available in the project's [wiki](https://github.com/olk90/shift/wiki).

## Locales

At the moment _shift_ supports two locales: English - which is the default- and
German. To change the used locale navigate to the Options dialog, select the
locale and save the changes. The new locale will apply after restarting the app.

## Theming

This app uses the [PyQtDarkTheme](https://github.com/5yutan5/PyQtDarkTheme).
There are both styles (light and dark) available. To switch between the two
simply choose the style in the _Options_ dialog and apply the changes.
